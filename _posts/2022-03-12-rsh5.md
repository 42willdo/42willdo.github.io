 # Heading home...
...through the beautiful landscape just at my
doorstep.

After a brief stop at the harbour of Burg on
Fehmarn, I went straight for the bridge and
off the island, because the wind had turned 
further south, which meant more headwind 
again.

The view only got better after climbing the nearest hill, about 70m.

Flowing hills, seeing the sea in the distance
and sometimes even being right next to the 
beach, I fought my way to Neustadt.

The existence of a nice road alonge the coast 
between Neustadt and Travemünde is no 
secret. And especially with the touristy 
places like Timmendorfer Strand in between
it was heavily crowded on a Saturday 
afternoon.

But then I finally reached Travemünde, 
already part of my home town Lübeck. Not
even the cramp in my left leg could stop me
now.

Last intermediate goal was Dassow, you 
might now that name since I also passed 
through there on my tour to the polish border.

From then onwards it was all auto pilot and 
let the legs do what ever they can.
So I finished my 5 day tour at exactly the spot
I took the picture the evening before leaving.
Thereby setting two new records for my self:
_most kilometres in a week: 608_ and 
_most consecutive days with more than 100km: 5_

**130km 5:49h 583m uphill 22km/h**

**Total: 608km 25:50h 2095m uphill**

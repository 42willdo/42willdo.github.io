# Reaching the finish line....
...felt weird. The last day of riding went by pretty quickly and without any major obstacles. Although it started with all the bakeries being closed on a 
Sunday morning and therefore without breakfast, the ride on to the island Usedom was nice. 
I took a longer break in Zinnowitz sitting at the beach and having lunch before finishing the ride and arriving at the marked border with Poland.
Right at the border it started raining but I still continued for the last 8km to the harbour of Swinemünde.
The second border crossing back into Germany on the road was nicer because it wasn't as crowded.
Still reaching the goal felt nothing like I had hoped it would feel. It wasn't a big relief, nor happiness and joy.
It didn't feel special at all, more like any other of the 392km before the border. Maybe it's because I was
alone and had no one else to congratulate. 
Congratulating myself didn't feel right. Riding there or anywhere else didn't seem to make a difference.
So the end was a strange experience but overall the tour was definitely worth it.
I would say the second day of riding was my favourite section of the tour but the whole experience was very interesting. 
The one thing besides all the landscapes and places I saw, that stood out to me, is the fact that riding became so normal.
The few rides I do around my home were always something special. I enjoyed every minute of it and 
was focused on riding and nothing else.
During this tour riding 80-90km in 4 hours every day became normal. Riding was like breathing. I did it without a second thought.
It's great to know I can do that for a couple of days and not be too tired or get any physical problems,
but riding my bike also lost something in that process. 
Difficult to describe all the experiences, but the last thing I want to say is, that I can only encourage everyone to try this or any other way of travelling for the sake of going out into the world and getting out of ones own comfort zone. 
See you in another adventure!!!

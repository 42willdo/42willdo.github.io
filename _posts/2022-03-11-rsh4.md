# Is it worth it?...
..._maybe_ or **definitely**? I'd say one only knows afterwards. 

The day started of with a beautiful view 
over the beach and a nice section through 
the forest, blocking some of the headwind.

And so I fought my way along major roads and into the wind - today more at 30km/h -
towards Kiel. Nice surprise: crossing the NOK
on one of the massive bridges, as even 
large vessels have to fit through.

It then took almost an hour to find my way through the labyrinth of cycle ways in Kiel,
which do exist, but they are often not where 
they are marked on the map and to cross a
4 lane maine road in rush hour you better
go back half a kilometre to find a traffic light.

Finally leaving Kiel behind I thought I was 
prepared for what was coming. But was I?

No cycle tour can be called an adventure, if 
there isn't an off road section  xD
And then you fight up a small hill into the 
headwind - now gusting up to 40km/h - 
and you stand in front of this:

No that is not the Atlantic ocean, but neither 
the north nor the baltic sea. This is just the 
_Selenter lake_, or what the wind turned it 
into.

Throughout the next part to Heiligenhafen, 
the wind frequently turned into a side wind.
That doesn't give you as mouch of a feeling of cycling backwards, but is quite dangerous
as the bike might be pushed half a meter to
the left from one second to the other.

Next it wasn't long until I could see the bridge
over the _Fehmarn Sund_. Riding over it 
wasn't even close to being pleasant, but 
that's what you have to do to reach an island.

Struggling with a massive headwind again,
Burg appeared on the horizon and I soon reached the youth hostel.

As the last thing tonight, in the beautiful starlight sky I saw the _Orion nebula_ again.
There is no way my phone could pick that up
but I have quite a good picture from a few 
years back. It's also in the slideshow on the 
welcome page, but I included it at the bottom, 
so you don't have to wait for the slideshow to 
run through  ;-)

**127km 6:09h 704m uphill 21km/h**
**Total: 478km 20:01h 1512m uphill**

That's the nebula at about 4x magnification:

# The first adventure of this year...
I am going on a new adventure! And it starts tomorrow.
This time I want to ride around Schleswig-Holstein (SH) in 5 days.
That means round about 100km to 130km each day, a bit more than on my
trip to the polish border, but I am again traveling a bit lighter.
Mainly due to the time of the year I decided to stay in youth hostels and BnBs,
since we still have -2 degrees celsius at night. Therfore I don't need any camping gear etc.
Another nice chage is my new bike, which I will properly introduce soon. It's a carbon 
race bike, which on its own only wheighs 7.2kg, obviously not made for traveling, but 
I can fit my frame bag, so everything I can fit in there can come along. 
Everything else has to stay at home xD So just to give you a rough idea, the bike
now wheighs with all bags attached, excluding water and food, **11.7kg**.
That is within a 100g the wheight of my old steel race bike on its own ;-)

For the route details and more background infos, just come back tomorrow evening.
I'll post from the first stop, which is in BÃ¼sum.
Have a great time and I'll be back with more tomorrow.

# Crazy little thing called...
...**wind**. Wind comes in all sorts of forms
and from all directions.
Notice anything in this picture:

Exactly, the wind turbines are pointing 
perfectly in the direction I am heading.
Therefore this particular form of wind is 
called a headwind, known by every cyclist.
Not as dangerous as a full storm or hurricane,
neither as tricky to compensate for as a 
gusting side wind, but man a headwind can
demolish your moral.

Even beautiful landscapes like these can be 
tiring, when you go into a 25km/h headwind 
for 5 hours out of 5:17 hours total ride time.
I was glad to reach the "Ochsenweg" at the
outskirts of Flensburg.

That didn't change anything about the wind,
but at least parts of the following section to
Kappeln were on smaller, better paved roads.

And then I reached the all to familiar Kappeln,
where I spent at least 15 out of 19 holidays 
together with my parents.

The last section towards Eckernförde along 
the bay was probably one of the best parts of 
the day. Just ahead of seeing the sea from my room in the youth hostel.

**121km 5:17h 515m uphill 23km/h**

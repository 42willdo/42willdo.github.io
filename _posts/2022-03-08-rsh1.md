# Best way to spend the holidays...
...on a bike, blue skys, barely any wind and 
almost empty roads, finished with dinner 
at sunset on the beach in Büsum.

The day started with a rather boring 2 hour
trip by train from Lübeck to Wedel. I already 
rode from Lübeck to Hamburg last year, so
I decided to skip that part and also get as far
out of Hamburg as possible and start at the
Elbe cycle way directly.

15min after the start...the first trouble with 
the bike. The front brake started rubbing
and the tools I hade with me could not reach
the bolt, so I had to search for the next bike
shop. All in all almost an hour later and I was 
finally back on the Elbe cycle way to 
Glückstadt.

After that the cycle way was no longer behind
the damm so I could see the river all along
to Brunsbüttel, where I crossed the NOK.
Nord-Ostsee-Kanal, the manmade connection 
between the north and baltic see.
**Fun fact** since the channel was doug on
command of Kaiser Wilhelm, he also gave 
every citizen the right to cross the channel 
free of charge. This right still exists today
in form of the "Kreuzungsrecht" and all 14 
ferrys over the NOK are in addition to all 
the bridges free of charge to use.

From Ostermoor the last 30km went through 
the meadows of Ditmarsch and behind the
coastal damm to Büsum, where I saw the
open see for the first time today.
Finishing with a beautiful sunset and dinner
at the lighthouse.

# Goals...
...are set out to be reached. Sometimes one needs time and a good friend to be reminded that stepping back is not an option.
I had moved my departure from Zingst back again and again untill I had only two days left before going back home.
Today was the second last day and not without some encouragement I decided that the job had to be finished. 
I was in the midst of letting my own goal slip out of reach and step back, saying it wouldn't be worth it.
Yeah there is no reason to cycle from LÃ¼beck to the polish border, but there never was. 
It doesn't matter why I set myself that goal. The only thing that matters is to reach that goal.
This time it meant booking myself in at a youth hostel in Greifswald and going there through rain, storm and mud. Crossing the country side in as straight of a line as possible and reaching my last overnight stop after another 90km,
without the tent and cooking utensils, therefore almost 3kg lighter and with an average of 25km/h a bit quicker ;-)

# The race track to the Eidersperrwerk...
...was the first intermediate goal after 
leaving Büsum.

The Eidersperrwerk is, as far as I know, the 
largest flood prevention gate in Germany.
And in my memory it was incredibly huge.
Well it wasn't as impressive as I imagined,
but that might be due to the fact I last visited 
that place when I was 5 or 6 years old. 
My parents had to grab hold of me, because the storm had almost blown me off the top.
On a calm sunny day at low tide it was not as spectacular but still impressive.


Afterwards the cycle way went mostly along 
the coast, crossing through the back country
only a few times and switching sides of the 
damm at least 15 times. Can you guys please
decide ??? xD

I took a longer break resting in the sun in 
front of the police station and harbour 
management in Husum.

The next beautiful part was just before 
Schlüttsiel: another race track alonge the 
coast with a beautiful view on the Halligen
and islands just of shore.

The last stop was Dagebüll Mole, another 
harbour with ferrys going to the nearby 
islands. Half an hour later I reached my
accommodation just outside of Niebüll at 
exactly 16:01, check-in started at 16:00 ;-)

**115km 4:19h 163m uphill 27km/h**
